## Variants

> Note: Some of this section is not my writing. See [Info](#Info)

- Need For Speed 2015: Valkyrie. Mixing of the song is noticeably different. This version was not officially released
but can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bknj3R74vlQ).

- Theres a bunch of remixes/variants at Battle Tapes' live shows. (Incl. Valkyrie, Feel the Same, Sweatshop Boys, etc) ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsgPT_x-RGI))

- A radio edit of Valkyrie exists. Intro is shorter, third chorus does not repeat a second time. ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x07JotjunBw))

- Feel the Same exists in GTA V's Radio Mirror Park radio station. It is pitch shifted. ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4786UaKAxNk))

- A full version of Why exists, but was not included in albums (due to uncleared samples).

- A slower demo of In Too Deep exists ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WFsooowaRLI))

- The In Too Deep featured in "The Naked Director Season 2 Trailer" has a different tempo and different mixing

- A (non-distributed) instrumental of Last Resort and Spa exists, with extra changes at ~3:00 ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J1I32dWEjk))

- There's 2 variants of Weight of the World. The second variant has a more "fuzzy" chorus. V2 was discovered closer to the Texture release, and is the same version found on Spotify's Texture release.

V1 | V2

Youtube | Spotify
Battle Tapes Website Download | Qobuz

- The Texture version of Syntax seems to be a different version as well.

## Unreleased

ðŸ¤«

> Note: Some of this section is not my writing. See [Info](#Info)

- An If Only lyric video was made but never released. Also with minor differences to the song. (Ex. ~3:00 has an extra "If only I could lose you" - not found in the released song) [Link](https://www.behance.net/gallery/158024975/Battle-Tapes-If-Only-Lyric-Video)

- According to these links ([1](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510005622/https://twitter.com/zyncmusic/status/1257163405472854016) [2](https://web.archive.org/web/20200511023106/https://twitter.com/HBO/status/1257112709989982208) [3](
https://web.archive.org/web/20200604223426/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsI4WwuTuPg)), there is a Battle Tapes collab with Valerie Broussard. Can't find this song anywhere, and the title is unknown.
Might be released on the new album, but Starts Right Here was not, so who knows.

- BMI has a repertoire that lets you [see the titles of some unreleased songs](https://repertoire.bmi.com/Search/Search?Main_Search_Text=Battle%20Tapes&Main_Search=Catalog&Search_Type=all&View_Count=20&Page_Number=1&Part_Type=PerformerList&Part_Id=k%252btrXQ9awZUEMuihUaVCxQ%253d%253d&Part_Id_Sub=YO0HedHMatLb45JzS23DVw%253d%253d&Part_Cae=YO0HedHMatLb45JzS23DVw%253d%253d&Original_Search=Performer) 

## Info

Made from a combination of info from the [Battle Tapes Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Tapes), the [Battle Tapes Discord Server](https://discord.gg/battletapes), and the ["Battle_Tapes_Discography.txt" (Discord Link)](https://discord.com/channels/420455270116753408/485095847529283594/884553822029115392) tossed around in there. 

Little of the writing here is mine, of course. Just a combination of all the sources I could find. Feel free to contribute at any time. Adding suggestions through the issues page should be the easiest way.
