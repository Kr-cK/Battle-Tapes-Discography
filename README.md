## Variants

> Note: A lot of this is not my writing. See [sources](#Sources)

- Need For Speed 2015: Valkyrie. Mixing of the song is noticeably different. This version was not officially released
but can be found on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bknj3R74vlQ

- Theres a bunch of remixes/variants at Battle Tapes' live shows. (Incl. Valkyrie, Feel the Same, Sweatshop Boys, etc)
See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsgPT_x-RGI

- A radio edit of Valkyrie exists. Intro is shorter, third chorus does not repeat a second time.

- Feel the Same exists in GTA V's Radio Mirror Park radio station. It is pitch shifted.

- A full version of Why exists, but was not included in albums (due to uncleared samples).

- A slower demo of In Too Deep exists (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WFsooowaRLI)

- The In Too Deep featured in "The Naked Director Season 2 Trailer" has a different tempo and different mixing

- A (non-distributed) instrumental of Last Resort and Spa exists, with extra changes at ~3:00 (YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J1I32dWEjk)

- There's 2 variants of Weight of the World. The second variant has a more "fuzzy" chorus. V2 was discovered closer to the Texture release, and is the same version found on Spotify's Texture release.

V1 | V2

Youtube | Spotify
Battle Tapes Website Download | Qobuz

- The Texture version of Syntax seems to be a different version as well.
